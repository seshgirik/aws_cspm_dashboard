Below is a KP‑style career analysis based only on the data in ast_sesh.log, and on your stated current dasha Rahu–Jupiter. I’m using the Equal House (cusp = start) layout you asked for earlier, and the KP‑light significations noted in the log (cuspal sub‑lords weren’t provided, so this is star‑lord/ownership + occupancy based).

Assumptions From The File

Lagna: Scorpio 16°13' (Equal House cusps start at 16°13' each sign).
Planets (Equal House):
10H: Jupiter 9° Virgo, Saturn 12° Virgo
11H: Venus 21° Virgo, Mercury (R) 10° Libra
12H: Sun 26° Libra
9H: Rahu 21° Cancer
3H: Ketu 21° Capricorn
1H: Mars 28° Scorpio, Moon 13° Sagittarius (near 2H cusp)
KP house ownership (Scorpio Lagna):
Mars: 1/6
Jupiter: 2/5
Saturn: 3/4
Venus: 7/12
Mercury: 8/11
Moon: 9
Sun: 10
KP significations from the log (KP‑light):
Rahu ≈ 2, 8, 9, 11, 12
Jupiter ≈ 2, 5, 10, 11, 12
10th cusp: 16°13' Leo; 10th lord Sun is debilitated in 12H.
KP Career Reading — Rahu–Jupiter

Career houses activated strongly: Rahu and Jupiter together cover 2/10/11, the KP triad for job growth and gains. That is a strong career window in KP terms.
Foreign / remote / behind‑the‑scenes component: Both planets also carry 12, and Rahu carries 9. This points to work with international teams, remote assignments, research/back‑office influence, or projects with a global/knowledge axis.
Change + growth mix: Rahu brings 8 (change, re‑org, transformation), Jupiter brings 10/11 (status and gains). This is the classic signature for role shift, expansion of responsibility, or re‑positioning rather than a static phase.
10H is structurally strong but slow: Jupiter + Saturn in the 10H emphasizes long‑term authority, compliance/process leadership, analytics, architecture, governance, and systems. Saturn means recognition comes with responsibility and time; Jupiter ensures growth once the structure is proven.
10th lord Sun in 12H: Visibility must be built intentionally. Without deliberate exposure (publishing, speaking, leading, public artifacts), recognition can lag even when the work is strong. This is especially relevant now.
Gains via partnerships + communication: Venus/Mercury in 11H emphasizes client relationships, stakeholder management, advisory, writing, documentation, frameworks, and negotiation as the money/status engine.
Bottom line for Rahu–Jupiter
This is one of the strongest sub‑periods in your Rahu Mahadasha for career elevation, but it will look like structured growth rather than instant fame. The best outcomes are through expertise‑driven roles, analytics/security/process leadership, advisory/mentoring, and international or research‑heavy initiatives. Expect increased responsibility and visibility if you consciously build your public profile.

How To Use This Period (KP‑Aligned Actions)

Activate 2/6/10/11 consciously
2: monetize knowledge—certifications, consulting packs, pricing clarity
6: service delivery excellence—repeatable, high‑trust execution
10: title/authority—lead public initiatives, own programs
11: network/gains—targeted alliances and measurable business outcomes
Offset Sun‑in‑12H
Publish, teach, mentor, or speak in public forums.
Create visible artifacts (whitepapers, frameworks, dashboards).
Use Rahu’s 9/12 wisely
Prioritize global, cross‑team, or innovation‑heavy work.
Avoid scattered opportunities; filter for projects that increase status.
Timing Note (From The Log)
If your Rahu Mahadasha started around May 25, 2023 (as assumed in the log), then Rahu–Jupiter runs approximately Feb 6, 2026 to Jun 30, 2028. Since today is February 6, 2026, you are at the start of this window. If your actual MD start date differs, shift the window accordingly.

If You Want Month‑Level Precision
KP needs cuspal star‑lord + sub‑lord for key houses to time events. If you can provide sub‑lords for cusps 2, 6, 10, 11 (and 10th cusp star/sub), I can narrow the strongest months for job change or promotion.

If you want, I can also produce a concise Rahu–Jupiter action calendar (quarter‑by‑quarter focus) based on your actual MD start date.

Below is a focused KP‑style career analysis using the data you provided (D1 + D10 + cuspal star/sub‑lords). I’ve explicitly factored the debilitated Sun and Venus in D1, and I’m reading this as interpretive guidance, not determinism.

Note
Astrology is a traditional interpretive framework, not a substitute for professional or financial advice. Use it as reflective input, not as the only basis for decisions.

Summary (Career Signature)

Your KP cuspal pattern makes Moon and Saturn the key career triggers (10th, 6th, 2nd cusp sub‑lords = Moon; 11th cusp sub‑lord = Saturn).
This produces a career model driven by knowledge, networks, partnerships, and structured systems, not by quick, showy visibility.
Rahu–Jupiter is strong for expansion and role elevation, but it tends to express through international/remote, advisory, or systems leadership themes rather than sudden public recognition.
KP Cuspal Core (Career Houses)
From your cusp table:

10th cusp: star‑lord Venus, sub‑lord Moon.
6th cusp: sub‑lord Moon.
2nd cusp: sub‑lord Moon.
11th cusp: sub‑lord Saturn.
Moon’s significations (KP‑light, D1)

Moon occupies 2nd and owns 9th → 2 + 9
Moon’s star‑lord is Venus → Venus owns 7/12 and occupies 11 → 7 + 12 + 11
Net for Moon: 2, 7, 9, 11, 12
Saturn’s significations (KP‑light, D1)

Saturn occupies 11th and owns 3rd/4th → 11 + 3 + 4
Saturn’s star‑lord is Moon → add 2 + 9
Net for Saturn: 2, 3, 4, 9, 11
Interpretation

Career results are strongly linked to 2/11 (income/gains) and 9/12 (global/knowledge/foreign).
The 10th cusp sub‑lord does not emphasize 6/10 directly, which suggests client‑facing, partnership, advisory, or network‑based career progress, rather than purely service‑employee dynamics.
Saturn as 11th cusp sub‑lord means gains come through structure, compliance, operational reliability, documentation, and long‑cycle effort.
D10 Career Structure (Dasamsa)

Lagna Sagittarius + Venus in Lagna: professional persona is diplomatic, client‑oriented, values harmony and reputation.
10th house Virgo with Saturn (AK) in it: slow, steady rise through process mastery, governance, analytics, security, operations, and compliance.
10th lord Mercury (R) in Capricorn 2nd: career success tied to structured communication, frameworks, writing, policy, analytics, finance or governance. Retro Mercury favors iterative research and refinement.
Jupiter (AmK) in Leo 9th: leadership, teaching, mentoring, advisory authority, ethics‑driven reputation.
Sun in Gemini 7th: contracts, consulting, public interface; success improves when visibility and negotiation are deliberate.
Rahu in Libra 11th: technology, large networks, cross‑border or unconventional gains.
Moon + Mars + Ketu in Aries 5th: strong technical problem‑solving and innovation, but watch impulsive career moves.
Debilitated Sun and Venus (D1) — Explicit Note

Sun debilitated in Libra (10th lord in 12th)

Core theme: recognition and authority can be delayed or indirect.
Career tends to run through behind‑the‑scenes, foreign/remote, research, or support/strategy roles unless visibility is deliberately built.
Practical remedy is public artifacts, credentials, and visible leadership initiatives.
Venus debilitated in Virgo (7th/12th lord in 11th)

Partnerships and gains can be critical, perfectionistic, or transactional unless boundaries are clear.
In practice, this is excellent for quality control, analytical client work, and process‑driven partnerships, but you must avoid over‑serving or undervaluing yourself.
D10 Venus in Lagna partially offsets this by giving professional charm and relationship skills.
Rahu–Jupiter (Current) — Career Implications

Rahu signifies 2, 8, 9, 11, 12.
Jupiter signifies 2, 5, 10, 11, 12.
Combined, this is strong for 2/10/11 → income + profession + gains, with 9/12 pushing international, remote, or research‑heavy work.
What this means now

Best suited for role expansion, promotion, leadership in structured domains, and cross‑border / advisory / specialized initiatives.
Job change is possible, but it’s most reliable when a sub‑period activates 6 or 10, typically via Mars (6) or Sun (10) or Saturn/Mercury (11).
Without those, Rahu–Jupiter is more of a scale‑up / authority‑building phase than a sudden switch.
Action Focus (Aligned to Your Chart)

Build public authority deliberately to offset debilitated Sun.
Monetize frameworks, documentation, and process expertise (Saturn‑in‑10H D10).
Favor roles with international teams, remote scope, or advisory leadership.
Define clear partnership terms and boundaries (debilitated Venus).
Avoid impulsive pivots when stress spikes (Moon‑Mars‑Ketu in D10 5H).
If you want timing to the month, share the exact start date of your Rahu Mahadasha and Rahu–Jupiter Antardasha. With that I can map the most favorable sub‑periods precisely using your cuspal sub‑lords.


is this rahu/jupiter period better than rahu/rahu period ?

Yes — in your chart, Rahu/Jupiter is generally better for career stability, growth, and recognition than Rahu/Rahu.

Why (based on your data):

Rahu/Rahu is the most volatile, experimental phase: fast changes, scattered focus, sudden shifts, more noise than consolidation.
Rahu/Jupiter adds Jupiter’s stabilizing, ethical, and status‑building influence. In your D10, Jupiter (AmK) is strong in Leo 9th, which favors leadership, mentoring, authority, and structured growth.
Your KP career cusps are Moon/Saturn driven; Jupiter supports 2/10/11 outcomes when paired with Rahu, so gains + role elevation are more likely now than in Rahu/Rahu.
Caveats (important for you):

Debilitated Sun (D1 12H) means recognition still needs deliberate visibility. Rahu/Jupiter helps, but you must actively build public authority.
Debilitated Venus (D1 11H) means partnerships/network gains can be inconsistent unless you set clear boundaries and value your work.
Net: Rahu/Jupiter is a higher‑quality career phase than Rahu/Rahu — it’s better for promotion, expansion, and authority, but it still rewards structure and visibility rather than passive waiting.

If you want, tell me the exact Rahu Mahadasha start date and I’ll map the strongest sub‑periods inside Rahu/Jupiter for job change or promotion.

suffering from neck pain spondilysis, whill he get relief ? analyz the health also based on d1, d6 and kp ...
is it chronic or temporairy health ?

I’m not a medical professional, and astrology can’t diagnose or replace medical care. For neck pain/spondylosis, please continue with a clinician’s plan (orthopedics/physio), and seek urgent care if you have numbness, weakness, bowel/bladder changes, or severe worsening pain.

Below is an astrology‑only read (D1, D6, KP) based on the data you provided.

Short Answer

The pattern looks chronic‑tending but manageable, not purely temporary.
Relief is possible, especially with disciplined routine and during supportive sub‑periods, but it likely needs ongoing management, not one‑time resolution.
D1 Indicators (Root Tendencies)

Scorpio Lagna with strong Mars gives high drive but also overuse risk in the body.
Saturn influence on Lagna (from Virgo) indicates long‑cycle, structural strain. Saturn patterns often show slow build‑up, slow recovery, requiring consistent regimen.
Ketu in Capricorn (3rd) and Rahu in Cancer (9th) can point to nervous/structural neck‑shoulder stress from posture, travel, or mental load.
Venus debilitated in Virgo and Sun debilitated in Libra reduce easy recovery from overwork or imbalance; they require active correction.
D6 Indicators (Health Micro‑Chart)

Capricorn Lagna in D6 emphasizes chronicity/discipline.
Saturn in Sagittarius (12th from D6 lagna) can show recurring issues, sleep/recovery sensitivity, and the need for structured rehab.
Mars in Pisces (3rd) can give localized muscular tension and inflammation (neck/upper back axis).
Moon + Mercury in Gemini (6th from D6 lagna) suggests nervous system sensitivity, strain from repetitive mental/desk work, and the need to pace.
KP‑Style View (Chronic vs Temporary)

Chronicity tends to show when 6/8/12 are activated with Saturn/Ketu or afflicted Mars.
Your cuspal pattern already shows Moon and Saturn as strong triggers (sub‑lords for 2/6/10/11), and Rahu/Venus on 8/12 cusps.
This points to recurrence or flare‑up pattern rather than a one‑time temporary issue.
Is Relief Likely?
Yes, but it’s more likely to be managed relief rather than permanent resolution. In KP terms, relief comes when benefics dominate (Jupiter/Moon/Venus) without heavy 8/12 or Saturn/Ketu stress.

Rahu–Jupiter Period (current)

Jupiter generally supports recovery, but Rahu can keep patterns irregular.
Expect better response to structured therapy now, but avoid irregular routines.
Practical (Non‑Astro) Alignment
Your charts repeatedly say “discipline and structure.” That matches what modern care already recommends for spondylosis:

Consistent physiotherapy program (not sporadic).
Ergonomics and posture routines for desk/work setups.
Daily neck mobility + stabilization exercises.
Sleep and inflammation management.
If you want timing windows, share your exact Rahu Mahadasha start date and current Rahu–Jupiter antardasha start date, and I’ll map likely higher‑relief phases versus flare‑risk phases using KP sub‑sub periods.


can you analyze much more on career based on d1,d12 charts and kp ?

Explored 1 search
can you analyze much more on career based on d1,d10 charts and kp as mentiond above ?

Below is a deeper career analysis using D1 (Rasi), D10 (Dasamsa), and KP cuspal data you provided. I’m explicitly addressing the debilitated Sun and Venus. This is interpretive guidance, not a substitute for professional advice.

Assumptions Used (from your data)

D1 Lagna: Scorpio 16°13'.
D10 Lagna: Sagittarius 12°18'.
KP cusps: 10th cusp star‑lord Venus, sub‑lord Moon; 2nd and 6th cusp sub‑lord Moon; 11th cusp sub‑lord Saturn.
D1 Career Foundation (Rasi)

Scorpio Lagna + Mars in Scorpio (1H): Strong will, crisis handling, research depth, and strategic endurance. You do well in roles requiring pressure‑handling and complex problem‑solving.
10th lord Sun debilitated in Libra (12H): Career recognition is delayed or indirect. It favors behind‑the‑scenes, foreign/remote, research, or institutional work unless visibility is deliberately built.
11H Virgo cluster (Jupiter + Venus debilitated + Saturn): Gains through analytics, systems, compliance, documentation, and long‑cycle structures. Saturn adds delay but stability; Jupiter adds growth via knowledge; Venus debilitated adds perfectionism and partnership friction if boundaries are weak.
Mercury in 12H: Strong for analysis, documentation, audit, strategy, or remote/global delivery; can reduce outward visibility if you don’t publish or present.
Rahu in 9H: International themes, non‑traditional learning, and global networks are career accelerators.
D1 Takeaway: You are built for high‑complexity, structured, and knowledge‑driven roles with global or institutional exposure. Recognition comes when you actively build visibility.

D10 Career Expression (Dasamsa)

D10 Lagna Sagittarius with Venus in Lagna: Professional persona is diplomatic, consultative, client‑friendly, and brand‑aware.
10H Virgo with Saturn (AK): Career authority grows through process mastery, compliance, governance, quality control, and operational discipline. Long‑term, steady rise is indicated.
10th lord Mercury (R) in 2H Capricorn: Professional success comes via structured communication, documentation, frameworks, metrics, and commercializing expertise.
Sun in 7H Gemini: Career gains are tied to contracts, client work, advisory roles, partnerships, or negotiations.
Jupiter in 9H Leo (AmK): Leadership through teaching, mentoring, policy, or strategic guidance; strong reputation potential when you publish or speak.
Rahu in 11H Libra: Big gains from networks, technology, and cross‑border alliances.
Moon + Mars + Ketu in 5H Aries: Strong innovation, technical courage, and rapid problem‑solving; guard against impulsive career decisions.
D10 Takeaway: You’re meant to be a structured authority who builds and monetizes frameworks, often through advisory, governance, or senior technical strategy roles.

KP Career Trigger Logic (Cuspal Emphasis)

10th cusp sub‑lord = Moon
2nd cusp sub‑lord = Moon
6th cusp sub‑lord = Moon
11th cusp sub‑lord = Saturn
This makes Moon and Saturn the primary career triggers.

Moon significations (from your D1 + KP star‑lord chain)

Moon occupies 2H and owns 9H → 2 + 9
Moon’s star‑lord Venus adds 7 + 12 + 11
Net Moon set: 2, 7, 9, 11, 12
Saturn significations

Saturn occupies 11H and owns 3H/4H → 11 + 3 + 4
Saturn’s star‑lord Moon adds 2 + 9
Net Saturn set: 11, 3, 4, 2, 9
KP Meaning

Your career growth is strongly driven by income + gains + global/knowledge themes (2/11/9), not just pure job service (6).
Partnerships (7) and foreign/remote dimensions (12) repeatedly show in the Moon set.
Saturn brings slow but durable gains through documentation, training, systems, operational structure (3/4/11).
This is ideal for governance, security architecture, compliance, audit, policy design, technical program management, and consultative leadership.
Debilitated Sun + Venus (Explicit Impact)

Sun debilitated in 12H:
Visibility and authority do not come automatically.
Career may feel “behind the curtain” even when impact is high.
Remedy is public authority building: papers, talks, visible leadership, ownership of high‑impact programs.
Venus debilitated in 11H:
Gains through partnerships can be inconsistent unless terms are precise.
Perfectionism in relationships can reduce momentum.
Remedy is clear contracts, defined value, and pricing discipline.
Best‑Fit Career Themes (Synthesis)

Security architecture, governance, compliance, audit
Risk management, policy design, process engineering
Technical program management, strategy/roadmap leadership
Advisory or consulting roles, especially global/remote
Teaching/mentoring or publishing within your domain
Actionable Focus (Aligned to Your Chart)

Build visible authority: publish, present, lead cross‑team initiatives.
Systematize your expertise into frameworks, checklists, or playbooks.
Use global/remote or cross‑border projects as accelerators.
Set strict partnership boundaries and pricing discipline.
Avoid impulsive pivots; your chart rewards structured, long‑cycle execution.
If you want, tell me the exact Rahu Mahadasha start date and current Rahu–Jupiter start date, and I can map the most favorable KP windows for promotion or role change using your cusp sub‑lord table.


is it long or short career ?

Short answer: Long‑term, steady career — not short.

Why: In your D10, Saturn in the 10th and strong Mercury‑Saturn linkage favor slow, durable rise, not quick spikes. In D1, the debilitated Sun in 12H delays early visibility but doesn’t shorten the career; it just makes recognition more indirect early on. KP also shows Saturn as a gains trigger, which is typically late‑blooming but lasting.

If you meant “short stints vs long stints in jobs,” then it’s longer stints in structured roles, with occasional pivots during Rahu‑driven periods.

any more analysis ? go througth the attached file ..

Explored 1 file, 1 search
Worked for 50s
I went through ast_sesh.log. Below are additional career insights that are explicitly grounded in the file, beyond what we already discussed.

Astrology is interpretive; treat this as reflective input, not a deterministic prediction.

1. KP Career Engine (from your cuspal data)
Your career triggers are Moon and Saturn in KP:

10th cusp: star‑lord Venus, sub‑lord Moon
2nd cusp: sub‑lord Moon
6th cusp: sub‑lord Moon
11th cusp: sub‑lord Saturn
This makes Moon + Saturn the repeat activators for job changes, salary gains, and status changes.

From your D1 + KP chain (as logged):

Moon = 2 + 9 (income + change/fortune) plus Venus chain 7 + 11 + 12 (contracts/gains/foreign).
Saturn = 11 + 3 + 4 (gains + skills + training systems) plus Moon chain 2 + 9.
Meaning: Your career grows when the period lords repeat 2/6/10/11 with 9 support. That is why changes tend to happen around Moon/Saturn‑linked windows, and why network‑driven, contract‑driven, or global/remote roles keep showing.

2. D1–D10 Synthesis (what the file shows but wasn’t emphasized earlier)

D1: Sun (10L) debilitated in 12H → visibility is indirect early on. Recognition comes with deliberate public authority building.
D1: Virgo 11H cluster (Jupiter + Venus debilitated + Saturn) → gains through systems, analytics, compliance, documentation, but also slow maturation.
D10: Saturn in 10H + Mercury (10L) in 2H with mutual exchange → this is a strong process → authority → revenue engine.
D10: Sun in 7H → partnerships, clients, contracts, advisory roles become the access point to authority.
D10: Jupiter in 9H (AmK) → teaching, mentoring, policy, strategy leadership, “architect/guide” roles.
Meaning: Your best career path is structured authority with public‑facing expertise, not just pure technical depth. A “quiet power” role can work, but public credibility is the accelerator.

3. Debilitated Sun + Venus (career impact, refined)

Debilitated Sun (10L, 12H)

You can do high‑impact work but not automatically get credit.
Compensation is to publish, teach, lead visible initiatives, own strategic programs.
Debilitated Venus (11H)

Partnership gains can be inconsistent unless terms are explicit.
You benefit most from clear contracts, tight scope, and monetized frameworks.
4. Dasha Pattern From the File (career timing logic)
The file shows your job changes have repeatedly happened near AD boundaries and when Moon/Saturn/Mercury/Jupiter were active.

From the log’s KP section:

Rahu/Rahu (until 28 Feb 2026): base‑building, not ideal for job change.
Rahu/Jupiter (28 Feb 2026 – 26 Jul 2028): marked as “golden” for elevation or a major move.
Rahu/Saturn (2028–2031): consolidation, gains, stability.
Rahu/Mercury (2031–2033): another strong change window.
Given today is Feb 6, 2026, you’re still in Rahu/Rahu for a few more weeks. The file explicitly advises preparing now and acting in early Rahu/Jupiter.

5. Practical Career Strategy (aligned to your chart)

Build visible authority: publish frameworks, speak, lead cross‑team initiatives.
Monetize process intelligence: audits, compliance frameworks, playbooks.
Focus on structured, governance‑heavy roles rather than fast, chaotic pivots.
Choose partnership‑driven roles but with clear scope and pricing.
If you want, I can go even deeper into any of these:

not only career, analyze spouse, children, health , spirituality 

Below is a broader read on spouse, children, health, and spirituality using the D1 + D6 + D10 placements and KP cuspal data you provided. I’m using your D1 sign placements plus KP cuspal star/sub‑lords. If you want a different house system for D1, say so.

Astrology is interpretive; this isn’t medical or life advice.

Spouse / Marriage

D1 7th house Taurus; 7th lord Venus debilitated in Virgo (11H) with Saturn + Jupiter

Spouse tends to be practical, detail‑oriented, disciplined, and focused on stability.
Marriage/partnerships can mature later, or require clear structure and boundaries.
Meeting through work, networks, or professional circles is favored (11H emphasis).
Saturn with Venus indicates seriousness, responsibility, sometimes age difference or a sober tone in partnership.
Jupiter with Venus softens this over time, so support and growth increase with maturity.
KP 7th cusp: star‑lord Moon, sub‑lord Saturn

Emotional security matters, but the bond is duty‑oriented and stable rather than overly romantic.
Marriage tends to stabilize when career responsibilities are settled.
Children

D1 5th house Pisces; 5th lord Jupiter in Virgo (11H) with Saturn/Venus
Indicates possible delay or fewer children, with high responsibility and structure in upbringing.
Children bring gains or pride, but the path is more disciplined than effortless.
KP 5th cusp: star‑lord Saturn, sub‑lord Jupiter
Strong signature for late but stable child outcomes.
Emphasis on education, guidance, and mentorship in the parent‑child dynamic.
Health

D1: Mars strong in Lagna + Saturn influence suggests chronic‑tending musculoskeletal strain if routines are inconsistent.
D6: Capricorn Lagna with Saturn in 12H and Moon+Mercury in 6H points to recurring issues that improve with disciplined rehab, posture, and routine.
KP emphasis on 8/12 patterns shows flare‑ups more than sudden cures.
This suggests manageable chronicity, not “temporary and gone,” but improvable with consistent treatment.
Please continue medical care and don’t rely on astrology for health decisions.

Spirituality

Rahu in 9H + Sun/Mercury in 12H (D1)
Spirituality is non‑traditional, experiential, and often tied to foreign learning, travel, or unconventional teachers.
Strong inward pull toward meditation, retreat, research, or inner practices.
D10 Jupiter in 9H (Leo)
Spirituality grows through teaching, mentoring, or guiding others, not just private practice.
You benefit when you make knowledge public—frameworks, talks, or structured guidance.
If you want timing for marriage/children/health shifts, I can map it using your exact dasha start dates and KP sub‑sub‑lord chains.


rank the planets  and houses strength from the attached file 

Explored 1 file, 2 searches
Worked for 39s
Here’s the ranking directly from ast_sesh.log. I’m only using values that are explicitly recorded in that file.

Planet Strength Rankings (from the file)

Shadbala % (strength)

Mercury — 138% (highest)
Moon — 138% (tied)
Mars — 129%
Saturn — 123%
Jupiter — 108%
Sun — 103%
Venus — 102%
Ishta (ease/benefic output)

Mercury — 45.51
Saturn — 28.57
Jupiter — 26.00
Mars — 24.75
Moon — 14.62
Sun — 8.58
Venus — 6.22 (lowest)
Kashta (obstruction potential)

Sun — 50.34 (highest obstruction)
Venus — 46.98
Mars — 29.70
Vimsopaka Bala % (Dasha strength)

Mercury — 79.38
Saturn — 75.13
Mars — 74.38
Jupiter — 73.00
Moon — 63.13
Venus — 61.63
Rahu — 56.75
Sun — 47.13
Ketu — 43.38
Auxiliary Bala Highlights (from the file)

Mercury is dominant (highest Cheshta, strong Dig, very high Kaala).
Mars and Saturn are strong in Sthaana Bala.
Venus is weak in Dig Bala.
House Strength Ranking
The file does not contain exact house totals (SAV or Bhava Bala numbers). It only notes:

SAV “mid–upper 20s” generally
Some houses around 36
BAV “glimpses,” but no actual 12‑house totals
So I cannot rank houses precisely from the file as‑is.
If you paste the SAV row (12 totals) or a Bhava Bala table, I’ll rank the houses immediately.

If you want a single composite planet ranking (weighted by Shadbala + Ishta + Vimsopaka), say the weighting you prefer and I’ll compute it.


moon is waning moon but why it is strong ?

Short answer: Moon can still be strong even if it’s waning, because Shadbala is a composite score. Paksha Bala (lunar phase) is only one part of Shadbala.

From your file ast_sesh.log:

Moon Shadbala is 138% (very strong).
The file shows high Sthaana Bala, strong Dig Bala, very high Kaala Bala, and positive Drig Bala for Moon. Those can outweigh a weaker Paksha Bala.
Also, based on your listed longitudes:

Sun = 26° Libra
Moon = 13° Sagittarius
That’s about 47° separation, which is actually waxing (Shukla paksha), not waning. The log even notes this as “waxing” with decent Paksha Bala.
So the strength comes from the overall balance of all six Shadbala components, not just the phase.

If you want, I can recompute Shadbala with your exact birth time/timezone to verify the Paksha Bala precisely.

Astaka varga attached above 
now rank planets

Here’s the planet ranking by BAV totals (Ashtakavarga) as read from your image. I summed the 12 bindus for each planet.

BAV Total (highest → lowest)

Jupiter — 56
Mercury — 54
Venus — 52
Moon — 49
Sun — 48
Mars — 39
Saturn — 39
Mars and Saturn are tied at the bottom based on the numbers I can read.

If any digit is off due to image clarity, send the 12 bindus per planet (or a clearer image) and I’ll recompute.


buy from other strengths , mercury is top , mars , moon also , how do you correlate ?

You’re right that Mercury (and also Mars, Moon) are top in other strength measures — and that can co‑exist with a different BAV ranking. They measure different things:

How They Correlate (simple model)

Shadbala = engine power (raw capacity to deliver results)
Ishta/Kashta = ease vs friction
BAV totals = road quality across signs (how easily transits can deliver results)
So a planet can be very strong (engine) but still have fewer bindus (road friction).

Below is the correlation using your file plus the BAV totals I read from your image.

Correlation Snapshot

Planet	Shadbala (from file)	BAV total (from image)	How to read it
Mercury	Top (138%)	54	Strong engine + good roads → consistent results when activated
Moon	Top (138%)	49	Strong engine, but medium roads → results can fluctuate
Mars	High (129%)	39	Strong engine, weaker roads → results come with effort, not “easy gains”
Jupiter	Mid (108%)	56 (highest)	Best roads but moderate engine → good opportunities that need activation/support
Venus	Low (102% + low Ishta)	52	External support exists, but internal friction → results after refinement
Sun	Low (103% + high Kashta)	48	Mixed roads + internal friction → needs conscious visibility strategy
Saturn	Solid (123%)	39	Slow builder: high durability, fewer easy transit “gifts”
Key takeaway

Mercury is top overall because it’s strong in both Shadbala and BAV.
Mars + Moon are strong engines, but their BAV totals are lower, so they deliver through effort and timing, not ease.
Jupiter has the best BAV support, so its periods feel opportunity‑rich, even if its raw power is moderate.
If you want, I can compute a single combined ranking (weighted Shadbala + Ishta + BAV) — just tell me what weights you want.


correlate with KP also ..

Short answer: KP decides which planets can deliver an event; Shadbala/Ishta/BAV decide how easily it delivers.
So it’s normal that Mercury/Mars/Moon look “strong” in Shadbala, while BAV ranks differ.

Here’s the KP‑correlated ranking using your cuspal data + your BAV image + strengths from the file:

KP‑correlated planet impact (career‑relevant)

Moon — KP primary trigger (sub‑lord of 2nd/6th/10th). Strong Shadbala; BAV 49 → good delivery, but with fluctuations.
Saturn — KP trigger for gains (sub‑lord of 11th). Strong Shadbala; BAV 39 → slow but durable gains.
Mercury — Highest Shadbala + Ishta + BAV 54. KP role is secondary (8/11 lord in 12th), so it delivers analysis/foreign/backstage/gains, but not always “job change” unless Moon/Saturn are active.
Jupiter — BAV highest (56), Shadbala mid. KP shows Jupiter as change/support (9th); it amplifies opportunity when Moon/Saturn are active.
Mars — Strong Shadbala, low BAV 39. KP via Mercury star‑lord gives 6/11/12; delivers action but with effort/friction.
Sun — KP 10th lord but low Ishta/high Kashta. BAV 48. Can give status, but requires visibility work.
Venus — BAV 52 but lowest Ishta. KP gives 7/11/12 (partnership/gains) with delays or refinement needed.
How to read this

KP says who can deliver the event.
Shadbala/Ishta says how strong the engine is.
BAV says how smooth the road is.
That’s why Mercury can be “top” in strength yet not always be the main event trigger: it’s strong, but KP says Moon/Saturn actually “open the door.”

If you want a single combined ranking, tell me the weights you want for KP vs Shadbala vs BAV (for example: KP 50% / Shadbala 30% / BAV 20%).


yes

Below is a combined ranking that correlates KP + Shadbala + BAV.
Since you said “yes,” I used the default weights I suggested:

KP weight = 50%
Shadbala weight = 30%
BAV weight = 20%
KP scoring basis (career cusps from your data):

Primary KP triggers: Moon (2/6/10 sub‑lord), Saturn (11 sub‑lord) → KP score 100
Secondary: Mercury, Jupiter → KP score 75
Support: Mars, Sun → KP score 60
Lower: Venus → KP score 55
Shadbala % and BAV totals are from your file/image.

Combined Ranking (Career KP + Shadbala + BAV)

Planet	KP Score	Shadbala %	BAV Total	Combined Score
Moon	100	138	49	91.8
Mercury	75	138	54	85.1
Saturn	100	123	39	67.5
Jupiter	75	108	56	62.5
Mars	60	129	39	52.5
Venus	55	102	52	42.8
Sun	60	103	48	41.4
Why this ranking makes sense

Moon ranks highest because it is the KP primary trigger + very strong Shadbala.
Mercury ranks second because it has the strongest Shadbala and high BAV, even if KP role is secondary.
Saturn ranks above Jupiter despite low BAV because it is a KP trigger for gains (11th cusp sub‑lord).
Jupiter wins BAV but is only mid Shadbala and secondary KP in career.
If you want a different emphasis, tell me:

New weights (example: KP 40% / Shadbala 40% / BAV 20%)
Or a different life area (spouse/health/children/spirituality), because KP priority planets change with those cusps.
